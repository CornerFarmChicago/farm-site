## Our Approach

Altgeld Sawyer Corner Farm is a teaching and learning garden, and we grow vegetables for our community.

Each team of gardeners is responsible for collectively tending a set of beds. We look for a mix of experience when making teams, so whether you're a seasoned gardener or this is your first season growning, we welcome you!

Visit our [Volunteering page]({{ site.url }}/volunteering/) to learn more and sign up.

## Raised Beds

Most of our vegetables are grown in raised beds. Most beds are four feet by four feet, and can grow an astounding amount of vegetables! Check out our [Farming Guide]({{ site.url }}/general-farming/) for more information about square foot gardening and how you can start your own plot at home.

## Community Herb Garden

We run an herb garden for the community at Altgeld Sawyer. Come by anytime and snip some herbs to use at home. Herbs grow better if they're picked often, so don't be shy!

## Compost

The Altgeld Sawyer Corner Farm accepts compost donations May through October on Wednesday evenings. Visit our [Compost page]({{ site.url }}/compost/) to learn how you can donate your food scraps and help us turn them into beautiful soil for the garden.

## Learning in the Garden

During the summer days, Altgeld Sawyer Corner Farm is full of excited young farmers learning about food and gardening. We partner with [Christopher House](https://christopherhouse.org/) and [The Kids' Table](https://www.kids-table.com/) and bring their students to the garden to harvest and make recipes from the vegetables we grow.
