## Team Beds

Most of our vegetables at the Altgeld-Sawyer Corner Farm are grown in raised beds. Most beds are four foot by four foot, and can grow an astounding amount of vegetables. Check out our [Farming Guide]({{ site.url }}/general-farming/) for more information about square foot gardening and how you can start your own plot at home.

## Community Herb Garden

We run an herb garden for the community at Altgeld-Sawyer. Come by anytime and snip some herbs for your personal use. Herbs like to be picked, so don't be shy!

## Compost

The Altgeld-Sawyer Corner Farm accepts compost donations May-October on Wednesday evenings. Visit our [Compost page]({{ site.url }}/compost/) to learn how you can donate your food scraps and help us turn them into beautiful soil for the garden.
