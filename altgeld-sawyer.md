## Team Beds

Most of our vegetables at the Altgeld/Sawyer Corner Farm are grown in raised beds. Most beds are four feet by four feet, and can grow an astounding amount of vegetables! Check out our [Farming Guide]({{ site.url }}/general-farming/) for more information about square foot gardening and how you can start your own plot at home.

## Community Herb Garden

We run an herb garden for the community at Altgeld/Sawyer. Come by anytime and snip some herbs for your personal use. Herbs grow better if they're picked often, so don't be shy!

## Compost

The Altgeld/Sawyer Corner Farm accepts compost donations May-October on Wednesday evenings. Visit our [Compost page]({{ site.url }}/compost/) to learn how you can donate your food scraps and help us turn them into beautiful soil for the garden.
