## Donations

We appreciate any and all donations! Whether it's money, seeds, soil, or gravel, everything will get put to to good use on the farm.

### Volunteering

Come volunteer at the farm!

We operate entirely thanks to our team of volunteers, handling farm tasks like planting, pruning, and watering, helping harvest with the kids from Christopher House or helping us with communication, fundraising, or planning events in the community.

Interested? Check out our [volunteering page]({{site.url}}/volunteering) to learn more and sign up.

### Share your skills

One of our favorite ways of engaging the community is to share our knowledge with you. We lead many workshops open to the public, exploring topics like square foot gardening, compost, canning your own food, and even first aid (you never know!). Check out our [calendar]({{site.url}}/calendar) for the latest goings-on.

### Come hang out

Corner Farm strives to create a safe and welcoming space in our garden. Come visit us and hang out! We hope that the farm can be a green space for the members of our community - enjoy a lunch break amidst the greenery, unwind with a book on a beautiful summer day, or drop in on your way home and pick some herbs from our Comunity Herb Garden.
