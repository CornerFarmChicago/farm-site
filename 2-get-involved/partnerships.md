## Christopher House

[Christopher House](https://christopherhouse.org/) is a family of schools that helps low-income, at-risk families succeed in school, the workplace, and life.

We partner with the Christopher House location in Logan Square, just across the street from the farm. Throughout the year, our volunteers work in teams to plant and tend to a variety of vegetables which are donated to the families of students at Christopher House. Corner Farm also serves as an educational space and outdoor classroom for the students of Christopher House, where students learn about how food grows and help with harvesting the produce that Corner Farm grows.

Together, our goal is to create a space where neighborhood youth can actively learn about how food grows, and provide the families of Christopher House with locally grown vegetables.


## Other Partnerships

Together with Christopher House, we help support [The Kids' Table](https://www.kids-table.com/), a unique Chicago cooking school which offers hands-on classes and events for tots, kids, teens, and families to learn recipes and skills to create tasty, healthy dishes.

Students from Christopher House and The Kids' Table meet at the Altgeld-Sawyer Corner Farm to learn about how vegetables grow, help harvest the produce, and turn it into delicious and healthy dishes.
