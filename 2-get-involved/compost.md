# Community compost 

Altgeld Sawyer Corner Farm accepts compostable scraps during our Wednesday Community Nights. Compost is open May through October, 6PM til sundown. 

We ask that neighbors respect the Wednesday drop off time, as our compost space is limited and we need our volunteers to accept and sort scraps for composting. No dumping – thanks!

Our composters turn your food scraps into soil used to improve beds at the garden, increasing our yields and the amount of food we can give to Christopher House’s food pantry.
