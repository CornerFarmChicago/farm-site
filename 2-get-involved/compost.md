# Community Compost 

Altgeld Sawyer Corner Farm accepts compostable scraps during our Wednesday Community Nights. Compost is open May through October, 6PM 'til sundown. 

We ask that neighbors respect the Wednesday drop off time, as our compost space is limited and we need our volunteers to accept and sort scraps for composting. No dumping—thanks!

Our composters turn your food scraps into soil used to improve beds at the garden, increasing our yields and the amount of food we can give to Christopher House’s food pantry.

		<h5>Pro Tip:</h5>
		<p>Collect your fruit and veggies scraps in a bag in the freezer. Prevents slimy veggies and gross smells—plus freezing helps the food begin its breakdown process!</p>

      <td>Too wet, too dry, or too hot. If too hot/dry, turn and add some water. The compost should be about as wet as a wrung out sponge; damp but not soaking.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bad odor—like rancid butter, vinegar, or rotten eggs</td>
      <td>Not enough oxygen, too wet, or too compacted. Turn the pile and add coarse dry materials such as leaves, straw, or corn stalks to soak up excessive moisture.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bad odor—like ammonia</td>
      <td>Too much nitrogen. Add materials high in carbon (such as shredded leaves, nontreated wood chips, sawdust, or shredded newsprint) and aerate.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Compost pile has earwigs, slugs, and/or other insects</td>
      <td>All good! Insects are a good sign of a productive compost pile.</td>
